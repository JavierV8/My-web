        Underworld is an American action horror film series created by Kevin
        Grevioux, Len Wiseman, and Danny McBride. It follows characters who are
        caught up in a war between vampires and werewolves (called "lycans"
        within the films). Most of the films star Kate Beckinsale as Selene.

        The first film, Underworld (2003), introduces Selene, an elite
        vampire-warrior who defies her orders, and Michael Corvin (Scott
        Speedman), a human who gets caught up in the war. The second film,
        Underworld: Evolution (2006), follows Selene and Michael as they are
        hunted by their enemies.

        The third film, Underworld: Rise of the Lycans (2009), is the prequel to
        the series, chronicling the origins of the vampire-lycan war. The fourth
        film, Underworld: Awakening (2012), is the sequel to Underworld:
        Evolution. In this film, humans have discovered the existence of
        vampires and lycans, and are trying to eradicate both species. A final
        film, titled Underworld: Blood Wars (2016), focuses on Selene who tries
        to stop a new war between vampires and lycans.
